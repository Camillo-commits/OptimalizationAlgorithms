# OptimalizationAlgorithms
Implementation of some of the most commonly used Optimalization algorithms
# Legal Note
Classes used in implemented algorithms such as:
* solution
* matrix  
were not created by Me. I do not have legal rights to that code and because of that it is not uploaded to this repository. Although their names and functions are self-explanatory, so recreating them should not be a problem.
